AIDS Prediction Project - Logistic Regression (ML)
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to analyze and predict the risk of AIDS based on given patient data. It’s a classic machine learning classification task wrapped in a clean, beginner-friendly pipeline.

🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Logistic Regression model training

Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

Visualization of results

Fully executable in Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Dataset
The dataset used includes various features related to individual attributes and behavior that may correlate with AIDS risk. It is assumed to be included as aids.csv (or similar) and must be in the same directory as the notebook.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
🔧 Requirements
Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

Libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
📂 File Structure
Copy
Edit
📁 your-project-folder/
├── AIDS_Project_chandan.ipynb
└── aids.csv (your dataset)
▶️ How to Run
Clone/download this repo or folder.

Make sure aids.csv is in the same directory.

Open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook AIDS_Project_chandan.ipynb
Run the cells step-by-step and follow the analysis.

📊 Output & Results
The model outputs accuracy score

Displays confusion matrix

Gives visual representation of prediction performance

Simple interpretation of results for beginners

📌 Future Improvements
Add more models for comparison (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)

Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

Deploy with Streamlit or Flask as a web app
